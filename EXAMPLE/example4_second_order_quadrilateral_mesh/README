Here is an example using an 8-node Quadrilateral element structured mesh scheme. 

The instability problem in the high order element is even worse! 

I'm trying to solve this instability problem. 

Please choose the time step very carefully, and stop the simulation once the shear wave propagates
out of the domain, otherwise, the instability problem will occur. 

The instability is caused by M-PML and the mass lumped technique. If you choose to use Pardiso to 
actually solver the linear system, there will be instability problem,  but the simulation time is very long!

You can use the wave_plot.m subroutine to check the wavefield which is in output file.
