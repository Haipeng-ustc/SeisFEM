Here is an example using a 4-node quadrilateral element structured mesh scheme. 

Please choose the time step very carefully, and stop the simulation once the shear wave propagates
out of the domain, otherwise, the instability problem will occur. 

The instability is caused by M-PML and the mass lumped technique. If you choose to use Pardiso to 
actually solver the linear system, there will be no instability problem,  but the simulation time is very long!

You can use the wave_plot.m subroutine to check the wavefield which is in output file.
