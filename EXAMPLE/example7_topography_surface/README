Here is an example showing the irregular topography problem. 

Note: Please note that the xmax boundary is set to be free surface (irregular topography ) because of some problem with the M-PML damping profile. So if you want to run some examples alike properly, 
write the node_xy.txt in the format(y,x) instead of (x,y).


Please choose the time step very carefully, and stop the simulation once the shear wave propagates
out of the domain, otherwise, the instability problem will occur. 

The instability is caused by M-PML and the mass lumped technique. If you choose to use Pardiso to 
actually solver the linear system, there will be instability problem,  but the simulation time is very long!

You can use the wave_plot.m subroutine to check the wavefield which is in output file.
