#  The seisfem is a 2D Finite Element code to simulate the elastic wave propagation problem,   #
#  which is developed by Haipeng Li. All the algorithm design is finished during my study      #
#  at University of Tulsa in Jingyi Chen's group, and the code is rewritten into c during my   #
#  intern in the Aramco Beijing Research Center.					       #

Here is example using exterior unstructured mesh scheme. 

Please choose the time step very carefully, and stop the simulation once the shear wave propagate
out of the domain, otherwise the instability problem will occur. 

The instability is caused by M-PML and mass lumped technique. If you choose to use Pardiso to 
actually solver the linear system, there will be instability problem,  but the simulation time is very long!

You can use the wave_plot.m subroutine to check the wavefield which is in outputfile.
