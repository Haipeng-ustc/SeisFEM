#  The seisfem is a 2D Finite Element code to simulate the elastic wave propagation problem,   #

Here is example using 6-node triangular element structured mesh scheme. 

The instability problem in the high order element is even worse! 

I'm trying to solve this instability  problem. 

Please choose the time step very carefully, and stop the simulation once the shear wave propagate
out of the domain, otherwise the instability problem will occur. 

The instability is caused by M-PML and mass lumped technique. If you choose to use Pardiso to 
actually solver the linear system, there will be instability problem,  but the simulation time is very long!

You can use the wave_plot.m subroutine to check the wavefield which is in outputfile.
